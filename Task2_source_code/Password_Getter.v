/*In this code, password_getter_sync is a module that captures a password input digit by digit on the positive edge of the clock signal i_clk. 
Here's the breakdown of the code:

input [3:0] i_digit; declares a 4-bit input signal i_digit, representing the digit being entered.
input i_confirm; declares an input signal i_confirm used to confirm the entry of a digit.
input i_reset; declares an input signal i_reset used to reset the password.
input i_clk; declares the clock input signal i_clk.
output reg [11:0] o_password; declares a 12-bit output signal o_password, representing the password being entered. 
It is declared as a reg type to allow for sequential assignment inside the always block.
The always @ (posedge i_clk) block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock signal i_clk.
Inside the always block, the code checks if i_reset is asserted. If it is, the o_password is set to 12'h000, resetting the password to all zeroes.
If i_reset is not asserted, the code checks if i_confirm is asserted. If it is, the code executes the block o_password <= (o_password << 4) + i_digit;.
o_password << 4 shifts the existing password left by 4 bits, making room for the new digit.
+ i_digit adds the new digit (i_digit) to the shifted password, effectively appending it to the password.
This code allows the user to enter a password digit by digit.
The password is captured and stored in the o_password output signal on the positive edge of the clock, with the ability to reset the password using i_reset.*/
