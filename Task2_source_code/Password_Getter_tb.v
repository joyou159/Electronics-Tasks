the hexadecimal representation of digit (%h), the binary representation of confirm (%b), the binary representation of reset (%b), and the hexadecimal representation of password (%h).
As the simulation runs, whenever the value of any of these variables changes, the $monitor task will display the updated values in the console output. 
This is useful for monitoring and debugging the behavior of variables during simulation.*/

/*In this testbench code (t_password_getter module), the password_getter_sync module is instantiated and tested with some input values. Here's the breakdown of the code:

reg [3:0] digit;, reg confirm;, reg reset;, and reg clk; are registers that store the corresponding signals used as inputs to the password_getter_sync module.
wire [11:0] password; is a wire that stores the password output from the password_getter_sync module.
The password_getter_sync module is instantiated as UUT and its inputs and outputs are connected.
integer i; declares an integer variable for loop iteration in the subsequent initial block.
The $monitor system function is used to display the values of digit, confirm, reset, and password at each time unit.
The initial block initial clk = 0; always #1 clk = ~clk; initializes clk to 0 and toggles it every 1 time unit.
Another initial block sets up the test scenario:
reset is set to 1 initially and then set to 0 after 2 time units.
A loop is executed 6 times where a random value is assigned to digit after 2 time units, and confirm is set to 1 and then 0 after 2 time units.
After the loop, reset is.*/
